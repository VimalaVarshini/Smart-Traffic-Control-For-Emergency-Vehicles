# Smart-Traffic-Control-For-Emergency-Vehicles
# Abstract

Traffic congestion is a major issue in urban areas, often delaying emergency vehicles like ambulances. This project proposes a smart traffic control system that prioritizes emergency vehicles by detecting their siren sounds and automatically managing traffic signals. The system employs Arduino UNO and LM393 sound sensors to recognize ambulance sirens and clear the path by turning traffic lights green in the corresponding lane.

# Components Used

Arduino UNO - Microcontroller for processing sensor data and controlling signals.

Sound Sensor (LM393) - Detects ambulance siren sound.

# Environment Used

Hardware: Arduino UNO, LM393 sound sensor, LEDs, breadboard, connecting wires.

Software: Arduino IDE for programming the microcontroller.


# Future Improvements

Integration with GPS: To enhance accuracy in detecting emergency vehicle locations.

AI-based Traffic Analysis: To optimize traffic signals dynamically.

RFID Tagging for Ambulances: To improve ambulance detection and reduce false positives.

Cloud-based Data Processing: For better traffic pattern analysis and control.

# Conclusion

The proposed system effectively reduces the waiting time of emergency vehicles at traffic intersections. By integrating sound sensors with an Arduino-based traffic control system, the solution ensures ambulances can navigate busy intersections efficiently. Future enhancements will further improve the systemâ€™s reliability and scalability.
